# Test Commit

This is a test commit to verify contribution graph updates.

The commits should appear on your GitHub profile contribution graph if:
1. The email in commits matches your GitHub account email
2. The commits are pushed to GitHub
3. The repository is public (or you're a collaborator)
4. The commits are on the default branch or any branch you've pushed

Your GitHub email: mahmedrangila@gmail.com

All commits are being made with this email, so they should appear on your contribution graph within a few minutes of being pushed.
